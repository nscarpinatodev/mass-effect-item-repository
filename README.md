## Module Systems

### Kinetic Shield System

All actors equipped with a **Kinetic Shield** item gain an active barrier that absorbs incoming damage before HP is affected. Shields:

- Are displayed as a temporary HP bar on the actor sheet
- Recharge automatically at the start of each turn (regeneration rate varies by shield tier)
- Can be upgraded with **Shield HP Mod** items that increase maximum capacity
- Are bypassed by certain damage types (configurable per shield item via flags)

Shield items use the `mass-effect-sf2e-conversion` flag namespace:
```json
"flags": {
  "mass-effect-sf2e-conversion": {
    "shieldMax": 40,
    "shieldRegen": 12
  }
}
```

### Paragon / Renegade Tracker

A GM tool for tracking the morality scores of party members across the Paragon (blue) and Renegade (red) scales, mirroring the moral choice system from the games.

**Opening the tracker:**
- Click the scale icon in the left Scene Controls toolbar
- Or run `MassEffectPR.open()` in the browser console

**Features:**
- Tracks all party members plus any manually added actors
- Adjusts scores with ±1/±2/±5 buttons or a direct Set field
- Automatically grants and removes perk items as score thresholds are reached (20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100)
- Activatable tier abilities (Inspiring Voice, Beacon of Hope, Noble Sacrifice at Paragon 40/60/80; Ruthless Efficiency, Command Through Fear, Uncompromising at Renegade 40/60/80)
- Hover perk chips for effect descriptions
- Score changes are whispered to the GM as chat messages
- Tier ability uses reset automatically on long rest (PF2e Rest for the Night)
- Actors can be ignored (hidden from the tracker) or manually added if not in the party
- Players can open the tracker to view their own scores (read-only)

**Paragon perks:**

| Score | Perk | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| 20 | Trusted Presence | +1 circumstance to Diplomacy |
